# ACER Report

ACER Report is a CLI completed as a code challenge for a job interview at ACER.  
This reporting software is designed to analyse a series of JSON formatted data sources to provide an insight on the performance of a student, whilst providing them with pointers on where mistakes were made and how to correct for them in the future.
